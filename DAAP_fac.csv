The oscillation between his research-based office and the design studio prompted his selection as a DAAP Annual Award recipient for Outstanding Research and Creative Work. His role of principal designer for the University of Cincinnati’s Aronoff Center for Design and Art required his relocation to Cincinnati in 1994 to oversee the 2.5 year construction process. The project was displayed prominently in the 1991 Venice Bienalle International Exhibition, and won the 1994 National Progressive Architecture Award.

Jordan Tate,ART,"Professor Tate has a B.Phil in Interdisciplinary Studies from Miami University and an MFA from Indiana University. He was a Fulbright Fellow in 2008-2009. His work represents a shift away from the understanding of photography as mechanical reproduction and an acknowledgment of the image-maker as the mediator of sight. Tate explores process and practice in contemporary image viewing and production. His work is based in ongoing research/meta-photographic critique concerning the visual and conceptual processes of image comprehension. Recent projects focus on the polemics of art/social systems, inclusion/exclusion, and the critique of institutional structures. ","Photography / Digital Media / Art

Jeffrey Tilman,ARCHITECTURE,"Jeff Tilman researches and writes on the history of American architecture between the Civil War and World War II. Professor Tilman researches the influence of the French Ecole des Beaux-Arts on American art and design, and on issues that illustrate the difference between the American and European Modern movements. His interest in historical preservation stems from a conviction that preservation is a part of architectural practice, and that no work of architecture is fully successful unless it addresses its pre-existing social, political, physical, and historic context. His preservation experiences range from a study of rural preservation issues in Central Virginia to historical advising on the restoration of San Francisco City Hall.","Historic Preservation

Creating with processes of craft and documented actions allow for consideration of how ethnic and feminine identity is laboriously performed and endured for the sake of belonging to a hostile state. Much of her work requires a multi-layered system of experimenting, scavenging and a regimented routine, a system of invisible labor that supports the Artwork.
